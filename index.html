  <div class="entry-content"><p>After installing Apple&#8217;s 2008-005 security update on my Leopard machines I found that ssh-agent was no longer being started on system boot.  I use <code>ssh</code> with key-based authentication for lots of things and not having it automatically loaded and communicating with my keychain was a real pain.  After monkeying around with lots of ways to get it going again I found the following command, entered in a terminal and followed by a reboot, did the trick:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>December 22nd and most of my shopping is done.  I hate doing this stuff at the
last minute but I do it every year so I must not hate it enough.</p>

<p>I had an interesting experience last night while shopping.  Early in the
evening I received an TXT message from my one of my monitoring sites
indicating that our production server was down.  After having great
experiences with Debian servers over the last couple of years this box had
experienced some heartburn from a recent kernel update and I figured the burn
might have returned.  I was not notified of the site being down again (the
monitoring script runs every 15 mins) so, after 20 minutes, I figured I was in
good shape or my monitoring script &#8211; recently rewritten &#8211; was broken.  Ugh.
As luck would have it there&#8217;s an Apple Store in the mall.  I went in, found a
row of lonely looking iPod Touches, grabbed one, and called up our
<a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org">site</a>. The Touch was already connected to the
store&#8217;s Wi-Fi and our front page popped up in just a few seconds.  I loaded a
few other pages on the site to make sure everything was hunky-dory, made sure
to leave PK&#8217;s website set as the home page for that Touch, and continued on my
way.  Thanks the the Apple Store I was able to get some network monitoring and
guerrilla marketing in as well as shopping.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some wins and losses this evening.  On the losing side was my last SANS class.
I&#8217;ve been taking their SANS+S course for preparation to take the CISSP exam.
This particular class is taught on-line using a Java-based classroom product
called Elluminate.  It&#8217;s always taken a bit of work to start it up on my
PowerBook and I generally expect to have to kill and restart it a few times
before it gets a good connection back to the mothership.  Tonight was worse
than usual, requiring a reboot &#8211; thankfully fast on a Mac &#8211; and hunting down
and deleting old Java Webstart cache files.   By the time I got it sorted and
got into my class it was already 30 minutes in and too late to get into the
flow.  I had a lot I wanted to get done this evening anyway so I bagged the
class; I can listen to a recording later and get caught up.   I&#8217;m in no wild
hurry to get my CISSP so will be spending a couple months studying up and take
the test this summer.  I already hold a current SANS GSEC cert and the subject
matter isn&#8217;t wildly different.</p>

<p>On the win side I think we&#8217;ve finally gotten Chris&#8217;
<a href="http://www.chrisabraham.com">blog</a> moved from MediaTemple to a dedicated
server.  It&#8217;s a largish site that, was getting killed by performance problems
with the (mt) GridServer system.   I think the full site &#8220;rebuild&#8221; is just
about done so he should be back in business in no time.  I hope it finishes
soon, I&#8217;m tired and want to sleep.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/webhosting/gs/">gs</a> sounds good in theory, but
in practice it&#8217;s been a disappointment and I think needs another six months of
testing and tweaks before it&#8217;ll be ready for prime time.  I won&#8217;t be around
then, I&#8217;m going to be moving this site back to my trusty
<a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a> as soon as I get the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across Bruce Schneier&#8217;s article on <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/01/choosing_secure.html">choosing secure passwords</a> some time ago but just reread it again.  I find the description of the efforts that <a href="http://accessdata.com/">AccessData&#8217;s</a> PRTK goes through to guess a password fascinating.  Once of the things they teach in security classes is that brute force attacks will always work; the only protection is in the amount of time it will take to succeed.  Throw a little intelligence into the guessing and that amount of time can get very short!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I picked up a new toy for myself for this last holiday season, a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/n800">Nokia N800 Internet Tablet</a>.  It&#8217;s very cool.  I bought it mainly to listen to streaming media and to keep up with e-mail and RSS feeds when not at my computer &#8211; which so far means lying in bed.</p>

<p>The experience has been pretty good so far.  I&#8217;ve moved all off my personal e-mail and feed reading to Google services, which offer plain XHTML interfaces if you know how to find them, and they work really well.  Actually Google calendar doesn&#8217;t work at all, which is a bummer, but I&#8217;ll see if I can find a N800 iCal reader and subscribe to my calendars there.</p>

<p>Media has had its ups and downs,
but I&#8217;ll have to write about that
another time, too tired now.  This
post will be a test of using the tablet
for blogging &#8211; the whole  thing has
been written using the on-screen
keyboard.  It will take some getting
used too, but it&#8217;s quite workable so
far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part one of attempting to get back to blogging at this site I&#8217;ve upgraded it from Drupal 4.7 to Drupal 5.</p>

<p>The old theme was quite ugly so I switched the system default to Drupal&#8217;s Garland theme and changed the colors to that sort of mix of sunburn and suntan than <strong>Lentigo</strong> suggests!  This looks better than the themes I&#8217;ve come up with in the past so I think I&#8217;ll stick with it.</p>

<p>This will have to be it for my first update in almost a year as my battery &#8211; both computer and body &#8211; are about to run out.</p>
