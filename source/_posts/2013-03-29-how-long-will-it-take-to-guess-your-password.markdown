I came across Bruce Schneier's article on [choosing secure passwords](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/01/choosing_secure.html) some time ago but just reread it again.  I find the description of the efforts that [AccessData's](http://accessdata.com/) PRTK goes through to guess a password fascinating.  Once of the things they teach in security classes is that brute force attacks will always work; the only protection is in the amount of time it will take to succeed.  Throw a little intelligence into the guessing and that amount of time can get very short!
