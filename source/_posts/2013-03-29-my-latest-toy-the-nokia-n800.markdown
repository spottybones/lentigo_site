I picked up a new toy for myself for this last holiday season, a [Nokia N800 Internet Tablet][n800].  It's very cool.  I bought it mainly to listen to streaming media and to keep up with e-mail and RSS feeds when not at my computer -- which so far means lying in bed.

The experience has been pretty good so far.  I've moved all off my personal e-mail and feed reading to Google services, which offer plain XHTML interfaces if you know how to find them, and they work really well.  Actually Google calendar doesn't work at all, which is a bummer, but I'll see if I can find a N800 iCal reader and subscribe to my calendars there.

Media has had its ups and downs, 
but I'll have to write about that 
another time, too tired now.  This 
post will be a test of using the tablet 
for blogging -- the whole  thing has 
been written using the on-screen 
keyboard.  It will take some getting 
used too, but it's quite workable so 
far.
