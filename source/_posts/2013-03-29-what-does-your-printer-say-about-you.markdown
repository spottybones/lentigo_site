Here's something to be aware of:
</p><blockquote>
<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/17/eff_cracks_hidden_sn.html">EFF cracks hidden snitch codes in color laser prints</a>:
<br />Many color laser printers hide information about your printer's serial number and the date and time of your print job in every job you print. It's believed that this is done to get your equipment to incriminate you without your knowledge. Now EFF has decoded the information-hiding scheme on the Xerox Docucolor series, by getting EFF supporters to print out pages from their printers and mail them to our researchers, who examined them under magnification and special light and cracked the code.

Whether or not you care what your printer (<strong>your</strong> property) is telling others, it's important to know that it <strong>is</strong> telling something to somebody if they want to look hard enough!
